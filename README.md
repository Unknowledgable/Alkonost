This project is a learning experience for my first proper and public coding project. If you're reading this, consider checking out any other projects I may have published.

**Technologies**  
Backend: Python 3.13 with Flask using the default templating  
Frontend: JavaScript and CSS for dynamic page rendering  
Database: PostgreSQL  
Deployment: Flask microservice hosted on my domain (link will be here when I launch)  
Version Control: Git + Github (:3)  

The objective of Alkonost is to provide high-quality, diverse musical recommendations and playlist generation that go beyond the repetitive suggestions found on platforms like YouTube. By building this project, I hope to fill what I feel is missing from the functionality of YouTube. In the future, the service may integrate with 3rd party platforms to deliver personalized playlists that users can fully enjoy rather than half enjoy. If youâ€™d like to contribute, critique, or suggest improvements, please reach out at 'kris.rush.projectsfeedback@gmail.com'.
